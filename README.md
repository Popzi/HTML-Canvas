# HTML Canvas

This was written in the course Script programming and Internet applications.
The task was to make a HTML canvas that contained a snowman and it also needed to be drawable by the user.


I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script
Open index.html in your browser or check it out here: https://popzi.github.io/HTML-Canvas/
